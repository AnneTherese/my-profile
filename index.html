				<h3>Singing🎤</h3>
				<p>I love to sing, I was taken in solo for a showbizz show in 2020 but it was unfortunately cancelled because of the pandemic.But I sing and record myself very frequently </p>
				<h3>Taking care of animals🐶🐱</h3>
				<p>I have been living with animals since I was 13 years old and have never been separated from them since then. I had six cats and three dogs in Reunion Island but when I came to France for my studies I was only able to bring two.  </p>

<!-- Sport -->

			<div class="card-white">
				<center><h2>Sport</h2></center>
				<p>I am not a very sporty person or not at all but in my childhood I was very sporty and I am still passionate about these sports. </p>
				<h3>Equestrian🐎 </h3>
				<p>I did 4 years of horseback riding when I was in elementary school.It's one of the best experiences I've had in my life and I think that's what gave me the love for animals.  </p>
				<h3>Swimming 🏊‍♂️</h3>
				<p>I did 3 years of swimming in a club. I hated swimming before I joined the club (I was very afraid of sinking like a brick) but the teachers really helped me to fight my fear and even to love this sport. </p>

<!-- Project -->

			<div class="card-white">
				<center><h2>Project</h2></center>
				<p>I am still quite confused about my future and I don't have a real project yet. What I do know is that I want to gather enough knowledge in order to some day be the head of my own company that helps animals and the poorest of the poor.</p>
